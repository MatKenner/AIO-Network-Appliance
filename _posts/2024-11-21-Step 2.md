### **Step 2: Comparing All-in-One Network Appliances to Our Appliance**

When designing or selecting an all-in-one network appliance, it's crucial to understand both the hardware specifications and the costs associated with the solution. For some users, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) appliances are ideal, while others may require a highly customizable solution that can handle a wider variety of tasks.

In this post, we’ll compare popular network appliances against our custom-built appliance that can handle the following roles:

- **Firewall**
- **DNS Filter**
- **VPN Server**
- **XDR (Extended Detection and Response)**
- **IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)**
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**
- **MDM (Mobile Device Management)**
- **Web Server**
- **Web Server Scanner**
- **Software Management Server**
- **WLAN Controller**
- **Image Deployment Server**
- **Backup Server**
- **Cloud Document Manager**

Let’s explore and compare four popular commercial appliances alongside our custom-built appliance.
