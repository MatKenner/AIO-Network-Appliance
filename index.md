Follow along with our progress as we develop and deploy a network appliance designed to use only open-source technologies. This network appliance will include a firewall, DNS filtering, VPN, XDR, SIEM, mobile device management, and more. This seemingly endless list of features will be packed into a single physical device that costs less than $400.
